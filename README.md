# VMBuilder 0.13
-----------------------------------------------
This is a fork of the official VMBuilder 0.12.4+bzr494-0ubuntu1, which 
is not any more supported, apparently.

* One major step was the porting to Python-3 and the availability of bionic
and focal plugins (so it is possible to generate system-images for those
distro too).

* One benefit from the porting to Python-3 is that VMBuilder now
works also on Fedora-34.

I wanted to share this work in the case it might be useful to somebody,
besides our internal use in our Computer Architecture lab at the 
University of Siena, Italy.
However, I can't follow the development of it, sorry.
I hope it helps.
